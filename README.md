# MongoDB :

This repository documents my exploration of MongoDB, a NoSQL database, through a recent course. It captures the key takeaways I gained from the learning journey, providing a concise reference point for future use.

**Covered Topics:**

This repository delves into the following fundamental concepts that form the foundation of working with MongoDB:

* **Databases and Collections:** Understand the structure of MongoDB, including databases as containers and collections as logical groupings of documents.
* **Datatypes:** Explore the diverse data types supported by MongoDB, enabling you to define the structure of your documents effectively.
* **Documents:** Dive deep into the core concept of documents in MongoDB, including their flexible schema-less nature and key-value pair representation of data.
* **Find Method:** Master the `find` method, your primary tool for retrieving specific documents based on desired criteria using filters and parameters.
* **Sort and Limit Methods:** Learn how to manipulate retrieved documents using the `sort` and `limit` methods for a user-friendly experience and optimized performance.
* **Update Method:** Explore the `update` method, allowing you to modify existing documents within collections through various approaches.
* **Delete Method:** Understand how to remove documents from collections using the `delete` method, including targeting specific documents or entire collections.
* **Comparison Operators:** Utilize comparison operators like `$eq`, `$gt`, and `$lt` to create precise queries for filtering documents based on their values.
* **Logical Operators:** Combine multiple comparison operators with logical operators like `$and`, `$or`, and `$not` to construct complex and refined search criteria.
* **Indexes:** Gain insights into indexes, data structures that enhance query efficiency in MongoDB, and understand different types of indexes available.

**Personal Journey:**
